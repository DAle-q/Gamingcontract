Simple betting game Clarity smart-contracts 

## Logic:

This is a simple betting game contract. There will be a target value set initially. There are 2 players Player1 and Player2 . Both the players will bet some amount. 
Whoever bets the amount equivalent to target/destiny amount is the winner for that round. 
Once the player wins , the contract will transfer the prize money in STX units equivalent to the target amount. 

## Getting started :

npm install 

## Run tests:

npm run-script dicegame
